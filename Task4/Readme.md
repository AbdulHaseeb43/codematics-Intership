🚀 Project Setup
To get this project running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

Clone or Download: Save the project files to your local directory.

Asset Organization: Ensure your images are placed in a folder named task-4 relative to your HTML file, or update the <img> src paths to match your directory structure.

Required images: logo.png, icon_awards.png, and club logos (e.g., 1.png).

File Linking: Ensure style4.css is in the same directory as your index.html.

Launch: Open index.html in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).

✨ Features Implemented
Custom Geometric Styling: Utilizes CSS pseudo-elements (::after) to create a distinctive slanted "cut-out" effect on the header and footer sections.

Flexbox Grid System: A fully flexible club-grid layout that ensures award winners are displayed in a clean, professional row.

Typography Focus: Precise use of Arial Black and hierarchical font weights to replicate a premium report aesthetic.

Layered Visuals: Use of z-index and relative positioning to manage overlapping elements and background effects.

Structured Content: Organized into logical segments: Header (upper), Award Categories (mid), and Future Teaser (lower).

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Semantic structure for content.

CSS3: Custom styling featuring:

Flexbox: For alignment and distribution of the club items.

Positioning: Absolute and relative positioning for complex layout overlays.

Pseudo-elements: Used for the decorative white corner accents.

Google Fonts/Web Safe Fonts: Arial and Arial Black for a bold, corporate feel.

📝 Note on Images
